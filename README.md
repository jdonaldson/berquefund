Eventually this site will track "soft" commitments for funds.  However, for now we're asking folks to send in:

* Pictures of Dave Berque (older the better)
* Stories about Dave Berque
* Other ideas for improvement.


The main goal here is to reach $150K.  We had a number of people mention
interest during a related meeting, but now's the time to get a little more
formal with our estimate and commitments.  We'll use this page to keep track of
the progress of planning, and also the donation commitments that we've
received.  It's great to do some for Dave after all these years.  Cheers to
everyone involved.

Send thoughts to Nate Moch or Justin Donaldson.  Regards!
