This fund supports scholarships for Computer Science students in honor of Dave Berque.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInitial Steps:\n\nCreate a Scholarship Fund: We will start by creating a scholarship fund through DePauw.\nSeed the Fund: Our target is to raise approximately $150,000 with pledges over the next 12 months. Donations can be made this year and/or next year.\nUtilize company matching programs to maximize contributions.\nMulti-year gift pledges are not feasible at this stage, as we need to complete this within the first year.\nFuture Possibilities:\n\nBroader Outreach: Once we have pledges from our group, we will reach out to other alumni through broader email campaigns and targeted 1:1s.\nPotential Expansion: Depending on the success of our initial fundraising, we may consider setting a higher target (e.g., a $2 million endowed chair). This would involve more support from DePauw and coordination with their larger capital campaign. At this point, larger, multi-year pledges can be discussed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n© 2024 Berque Fund.
