Initial Steps:

* Create a Scholarship Fund: We will start by creating a scholarship fund through DePauw.
* Seed the Fund: Our target is to raise approximately $150,000 with pledges over the next 12 months. Donations can be made this year and/or next year.
* Utilize company matching programs to maximize contributions.
* Multi-year gift pledges are not feasible at this stage, as we need to complete this within the first year.
* Future Possibilities:
  * Broader Outreach: Once we have pledges from our group, we will reach out to other alumni through broader email campaigns and targeted 1:1s.
  * Potential Expansion: Depending on the success of our initial fundraising, we may consider setting a higher target (e.g., a $2 million endowed chair).
  This would involve more support from DePauw and coordination with their larger capital campaign.
  At this point, larger, multi-year pledges can be discussed.
